1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, on Teams video call, on Discord)?

We will opt for online meetings on Thursdays, and either a physical meeting on Wednesday after the lab, or an online meeting on Monday. Depending on our soft deadlines for our project, we may schedule stand up meetings to coordinate and
check our progress.

2. Where will we record our meeting minutes (e.g. Teams documents, Gitlab Wiki, Gitlab markdown file)?

We can record our meetings using a gitlab markdown file.

3. Where will we communicate (e.g. Teams channel, Discord, Messenger)?

We will primarily communicate on our teams channel for transparency reasons, although we may use alternative messaging channels.

4. What is a reasonable response time for messages/posts when communicating?

For standup meetings, a response time of 24-48 hours seems reasonable. Urgent matters should be resolved ASAP if the deadline is fast approaching.

5. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.

We will handle conflicts by communicating on our teams channel in a respectful manner.

6. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. can't meet a deadline or stuck debugging).

Should a team member have difficulty with the project, it should be discussed either ASAP or on our teams channel so that we can promptly assist/act. If someone goes radio silent and we've exhausted all efforts trying to contact them, we may have to contact the tutor.
